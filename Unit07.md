**Unit 7: Westward Expansion** <span id="7"></span> 
*John L. O’Sullivan, editor of the influential* United States Magazine
and Democratic Review*, gave the expansionist movement now referred to
as* Manifest Destiny *its name in 1845, when he wrote that it was ”the
fulfillment of our manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted
by Providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying
millions.” Manifest Destiny was an ideology of expansion stimulated by
nationalism and an idealistic vision of American progress. Many believed
that it was America’s providential duty to extend the blessings of
liberty and equality across the continent. But, according to its
19th century proponents, Manifest Destiny was a vision reserved for
white Americans alone; black slaves, Native American tribes, and other
“foreigners” were displaced and exploited.  
  
 In this unit, you will consider the events and conflicts that grew out
of Manifest Destiny. You will first learn about the advent of western
expansion in the 1830s and 1840s, examining which native peoples lived
in the present day American West and why settlers pioneered there. You
will learn to distinguish between the myths and realities of the West.
Next, you will study the California Gold Rush, the contested boundary
between the U.S. and Britain in the Pacific Northwest, and the clash
between the U.S. and Mexico over the possession of Texas, a region that
was transformed from a Mexican territory to an independent republic to a
slave-holding state through war and violence.*
