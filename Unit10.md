**Unit 10: The Civil War** <span id="10"></span> 
*The outbreak of a civil war between the Union and the Confederacy
marked the collapse of the federal union created by the Founders in
1776. Two separate nations emerged – the Union in the North and the
Confederate States of America in the South – where one had once existed.
In fact, some historians consider the American Civil War the first
modern war because it pitted two modern nation-states against one
another in a bitter contest over property rights, economy, and the role
of federal and state governments. While Thomas Jefferson had defined
Americans as a single “people” in his Declaration of 1776, Northerners
and Southerners went to war in 1861 precisely because they considered
themselves to be two separate “peoples” unable to reconcile their
differences.  
  
 In all, over 620,000 soldiers died in the Civil War, more than the
total American casualties in all other wars combined until the Vietnam
War. The extraordinary scale of death and devastation during the Civil
War made it one of the most pivotal events in American history.  
  
 In this unit, you will examine the emergence of the North and the South
as two distinct nations, the major battles and military strategies that
determined the course of the conflict, Lincoln’s leadership, and the
social and economic impact of the Civil War.*
