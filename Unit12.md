     **Note**: This exam is designed as a practice exam for the
    StraighterLine administered US History I exam.  To earn actual
    transfer credit for college, you will need to pass the official
    StraighterLine exam, which you can register for here.  Please
    remember that unlike Saylor.org exams, there is a cost associated
    with StraighterLine exams.

    Foundation and StraighterLine, including information about
    potentially earning college credit, go here.
