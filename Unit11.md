**Unit 11: Reconstruction** <span id="11"></span> 
*Even before the last shots of the Civil War had been fired, President
Lincoln and members of Congress faced serious questions about how to
rebuild and reunite the war-torn United States and provide for nearly
four million former slaves. The way in which the government responded to
these questions shaped and defined the period now known as
Reconstruction (the 12-year period following the Civil War from 1865 to
1877). Reconstruction was a time of significant political and social
change in the United States. In this unit, we will take a look at the
controversial origins of Reconstruction and evaluate its successes and
failures. We will also examine how former slaves struggled against
prejudice and political repression in the American South as they
attempted to build new lives for themselves and their families. Finally,
we will ask why Reconstruction came to an abrupt end in 1877 and
evaluate its political and social legacy in the United States.*

     Instructions: Read this 1866 proclamation in which President Andrew
    Johnson notes all the official statements made by the U.S.
    government during the Civil War about the South being in a state of
    rebellion against the Union. He then concludes that civil order and
    police authority have been restored to the South, and it is no
    longer officially in a state of insurrection. Johnson’s proclamation
    opened the door for these states to rejoin the Union politically,
    economically, and socially.  
      
     After reading this document, please consider the following
    questions:  

    -   What does this document tell us about President Johnson’s
        opinion of the Confederate States of America and the concept of
        secession?
    -   What does this document reveal concerning Johnson’s position on
        the rights of Americans under the U.S. Constitution?
    -   How might the views expressed by Johnson here help explain his
        later opposition to Congressional Reconstruction (see subunit
        11.1.2 below)?

    Reading the document and answering the questions above should take

     This resource discusses the role that Congress played in
    Reconstruction. Congressional Republicans objected to President
    Andrew Johnson’s weak Reconstruction policies that allowed former
    Confederates to reenter political office and did little to protect
    the civil rights of newly freed African Americans. They passed
    important Constitutional amendments guaranteeing blacks voting
    rights and U.S. citizenship. Congress also ordered the U.S. Army to
    establish military districts in the South in order to enforce these
    new laws. Southern states could regain home rule only after they
    agreed to ratify the new civil rights legislation.

     Instructions: Read this June 20, 1866 report in which Northern
    Republicans in Congress challenged President Andrew Johnson’s plans
    to allow Southern states to once again elect senators and
    representatives.  The congressmen argued that the Southern states
    voluntarily withdrew from the Union and consequently lost their
    right to elect members to Congress.  They asserted that Southern
    states should only be allowed to return members to Congress once
    they had reorganized their state governments and addressed civil
    rights concerns.  
      
     After reading this document, please consider the following
    questions:  

    -   What reasons were given in this congressional report for
        suspending the rights of some of the inhabitants of the former
        Confederacy?
    -   According to this report why was it necessary to guarantee the
        rights of the African American freedmen?
    -   How would the proposals made in this report enable the
        Republican Party to dominate in the states of the former
        Confederacy?

     This resource discusses the impeachment trial of President Andrew
    Johnson. Radical Republicans in Congress objected to Johnson’s
    sympathetic attitude toward the South and passed the Military
    Reconstruction Act and civil rights legislation over his veto. When
    Johnson challenged Congress’s power to oversee Reconstruction
    efforts, the House of Representatives drew up impeachment charges
    against him and put him on trial. Johnson was not impeached, but he
    did leave office once his term expired.

     Instructions: Read this 1867 appeal to Congress in which prominent
    African American advocate, Frederick Douglass, discusses the
    importance of voting rights for his people. He warns the members of
    Congress that Southernwhite Democrats will unite with Northern
    Democrats to regain control of the federal government if the
    Republicans in Congress do not enforce voting rights for African
    Americans. If the Democrats secure control of Congress, they will
    stop enforcing civil rights laws and take away African Americans’
    hard-won freedoms.  
      
     After reading this document, please consider the following
    questions:  

    -   In his appeal, what arguments does Frederick Douglass employ to
        persuade Congress to grant African Americans the right to vote?
    -   According to Douglass, what would be the negative consequences
        of denying African Americans the right to vote?

     This resource discusses the political measures that many Southern

    and work in jobs of their choosing.

     This resource focuses on the political and economic turmoil in the
    United States during the 1870s. Economic panic and political
    corruption in the federal government distracted many Americans in
    the North from the ongoing social and legal problems that African
    Americans faced in the South. The disputed election of 1876 enabled
    Democrats to make a compromise with Republicans that ended
    Reconstruction in exchange for Republican Rutherford B. Hayes
    gaining the presidency. The end of Reconstruction allowed Southern
    states to restore unjust racial codes that openly discriminated
    against African Americans.
