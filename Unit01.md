**Unit 1: Creating British America** <span id="1"></span> 
*That North America eventually became British America was not a given.
During the 16th and 17th centuries, several European powers – including
the Netherlands, France, Spain, and England – struggled with Native
Americans and with each other for control of the land that lay between
what is now Canada and the Caribbean. Settlement boundaries were
constantly drawn and redrawn as a result of conflicts in the New World
and wars in Europe. Additionally, the cultures and customs of diverse
native peoples helped shape the nature of European settlements in the
New World but were ultimately destroyed by European war and
settlement.  
  
 This unit will begin with an investigation of European colonization and
settlement patterns in New France, New Spain, New Netherlands, and
English/British North America, paying close attention to the impact that
these New World colonies had on Native American Indians. You will then
shift your focus to the formation of the Anglo-American colonies: New
England, the Middle Colonies, and the Lower Colonies. You will examine
the economy, society, and government of these colonies. Finally, you
will conclude the unit in the mid-18th century with the Seven Years’ War
and the rapid change that this world conflict produced in British
America.*

     Christopher Columbus has become a controversial character in the
    history of the Americas. Some hail him as a brave discoverer who
    opened the continent for European exploration and trade, while
    others criticize him for his exploitation of native peoples, his
    great desire for riches, and his determination to bring Christianity
    to the Americas, all of which played a role in the extermination of
    native peoples and the eventual subjugation of those who survived.
    The passages are from Columbus’ diary of his 1492 journey to the New
    World. Which sections provide special insight on Columbus’
    mindset?

     Instructions: As you read, look for consistencies in the way that
    native peoples were treated across different geographic regions.  
      
     Bartolomé de las Casas was a Catholic monk who was one of the first
    European explorers and settlers in North and Central America.
    Although he at first participated in the subjugation of the native
    peoples of the New World, he soon came to oppose and then document
    the brutal enslavement and torture of native peoples by the European
    colonizers. His documentation of such treatment was part of his
    larger crusade to establish universal human rights for conquered
    people, and he used this material to argue with kings and emperors
    for better treatment of native peoples.

     Instructions: Read the English Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights
    was created in 1689, at the height of the English Civil War, which
    was a struggle between King Charles I and Parliament and its
    followers, called *Parliamentarians*, who rebelled against the
    King’s absolutism.  
      
     After several years of conflict, Charles I was executed and
    Parliament established a republican commonwealth, then a Puritan
    dictatorship, and finally reestablished the monarchy under the
    authority of Parliament. The English Civil War established the
    precedent of representative government that limited the power of the
    monarch.  
      
     As you read the English Bill of Rights, think about which ideas may
    have been influential in the colonies.

    delivered this sermon, in which he urged the settlers to establish
    the colony as a model Christian “city on a hill” from which the
    world could learn how to live a godly and principled life. In many
    ways, Winthrop’s vision has remained a part of American ideology
    since the 17<sup>th</sup> century. As you read the sermon, note

    What were the attractions, according to Hammond, of these two

    in these colonies as indentured servants? Based on Hammond’s
    testimony what were the factors discouraging immigration to these
