**Unit 2: A New Nation Forms** <span id="2"></span> 
*In the wake of the Seven Years’ War, Britain imposed new taxes and
restrictions upon the British American colonies to help pay for the war.
The colonies balked at these measures and argued that the British
Parliament was not authorized to regulate trade or impose duties and
that these matters could only be handled by provincial assemblies.
Although many colonists protested the new imperial taxes, few believed
it warranted their secession from Britain. It was not until 1775, after
George III failed to address the grievances of the colonists, that a
break with Britain seemed legitimate and necessary.  
  
 In this unit, you will learn how the Revolutionary War made America
independent of Britain but also brought many unresolved questions to the
fore. What constituted an American people? What was the nature of power
and liberty? How would America survive in a dangerous world dominated by
European empires? What would the American union look like, and how would
it be bound together? In this unit, you will consider how these
questions dominated debates about the Imperial Crisis, the American
Revolution, the Articles of Confederation, the creation of the federal
Constitution, and the nature of the new federal union.*

    for free)  
      
     Instructions: Read this part of this pamphlet. Thomas Paine’s
    *Common Sense *was the most popular and radical pamphlet of the
    Revolutionary War era. Published in January 1776, Paine’s work had
    the largest circulation of any book in American history. Addressed
    toward middling British Americans, not elites, Paine used plain
    language to argue for the “common sense” answer to British America’s
    problems with Britain: independence. Although few colonists
    supported independence in early 1776, Paine’s 46-page pamphlet
    mobilized new support for separation from Britain.  
     When reading this document, please consider the following
    questions: What, according to Paine, are the benefits of a
    republican form of government as opposed to a monarchal system? How
    had the British monarch harmed the interests of the American
    colonists?

     Instructions: The excerpt below is of a letter by the clergyman
    William Smith. Using the pseudonym Cato, Smith argues that
    independence would have devastating effects on British America.  
      

    *“We have already declared ourselves independent, as to all useful
    purposes, by resisting our oppressors upon our own foundation. And
    while we keep upon this ground, without connecting ourselves with
    any foreign nations, to involve us in fresh difficulties and
    endanger our liberties still further, we are able, in our own
    element (upon the shore), to continue this resistance; and it is our
    duty to continue it till Great Britain is convinced (as she must
    soon be) of her fatal policy, and open her arms to reconciliation,
    upon the permanent and sure footing of mutual interests and safety.*

    *Upon such a footing, we may again be happy. Our trade will be
    revived. Our husbandmen, our mechanics, our artificers will
    flourish. Our language, our laws, and manners being the same with
    those of the nation with which we are again to be connected, that
    connection will be natural; and we shall the more easily guard
    against future innovations. Pennsylvania has much to lose in this
    contest and much to hope from a proper settlement of it. We have
    long flourished under our charter government. What may be the
    consequences of another form we cannot pronounce with certainty; but
    this we know, that it is a road we have not traveled and may be
    worse than it is described.”*
