**Unit 8: Impending Crisis** <span id="8"></span> 
*In the 1850s, the “slavery question” fomented sectional crises that
threatened to destroy the very existence of the federal union. Two main
questions manifested themselves in sectional disputes*: *The first was
whether or not slavery should exist in new territories and new states;
the second was whether or not the federal government had a legislative
role in the formation of new western states. These questions were never
fully resolved during the 1850s, despite the adoption of the idea of*
popular sovereignty*, the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska
Act.  
  
 In this unit, you will examine how this lack of resolution exacerbated
Northerners’ fears of Southerners’ “slave power conspiracy,” while the
passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, the Dred Scott case, and John Brown’s
raid on Harper’s Ferry all deepened the growing rift between the North
and the South.*

     The Fugitive Slave Act was one of the most controversial parts of
    the Compromise of 1850. Passage of the law incensed many
    Northerners, who refused to be complicit in enforcing slaveholders’
    rights above the Mason-Dixon Line, and only served to heighten
    Northern fears of a slave power conspiracy. Do you believe that the
    law’s supporters were caught off guard by the vocal and widespread
    opposition to it?

    examines the Underground Railroad and narratives written by slaves,

     Opinions of the Underground Railroad in this era illustrate the
    gulf that separated abolitionists and slave owners. Whereas
    abolitionists viewed this enterprise as a noble crusade, slave
    owners considered it to be a criminal activity.

**8.2.2 Nativism and the Know Nothing Party** <span id="8.2.2"></span>

    Nothing”](http://resources.saylor.org.s3.amazonaws.com/HIST/HIST211/HIST211-8.2.2-KnowNothing-CCBYSA_files/HIST211-8.2.2-KnowNothing-CCBYSA.html) (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Read this article which summarizes the origin,
    membership, and political beliefs of the American (“Know Nothing”)
    Party in the 1850s. How did the demise of the Whigs contribute to
    the emergence of this party?  
      
     On the eve of the American Revolution most American colonists were
    descended from English, Scot, and Scots-Irish settlers and were of
    the Protestant faith. Leading Americans in these times, such as
    Benjamin Franklin and Samuel Adams, were leery of the migration of
    non-English speakers into the colonies (Franklin) and viewed the
    Roman Catholic faith as a dangerous superstition that should not be
    tolerated in the colonies (Adams).  
        
     With the influx of large numbers of Roman Catholic Irish and German
    immigrants by the mid-19th century, “native” Americans (those of
    British ancestry and of the Protestant faith) became increasingly
    worried about the future of the republic as they held the same
    opinions and prejudices as did Franklin and Adams. This nativism was
    the impetus for the emergence and foundation of the Know Nothing
    Party.

    of slavery during his campaign. He lost, but his strong showing

    Republicans, such as John C. Frémont, who, in the 1856 election, was
    the first presidential candidate of the Republican Party.  The
    opinions expressed by these Republicans and abolitionists reveal the
    party’s strong objections to the institution of slavery.  What are

    had no constitutional right to prohibit slavery in the territories.
     While the decision was well-received by slaveholders in the South,
    many Northernerswere outraged.  The decision greatly influenced the
    nomination of Abraham Lincoln to the Republican Party and his
    subsequent election, which in turn led to the South’s secession from
    the Union.

    Then, click on the link “John Brown” under “Explore” and read the
    accompanying text.   
        
     John Brown was a failed farmer and businessman who became fiercely
    opposed to slavery and believed that he was divinely inspired to
    lead a slave revolt that would destroy slavery. After his
    participation in Bleeding Kansas and against the advice of other
    anti-slavery advocates, including Frederick Douglass, he led an
    assault on the federal arsenal at Harper’s Ferry in Virginia in
    1859.  
        
     The intent of the plan was to seize the arsenal, arm local slaves
    with weapons, and bring down the institution of slavery. The raid
    failed, however, and Brown was tried and convicted of treason in
    1859. His address to the jury during his trial indicates the depth
    of his anti-slavery convictions.
