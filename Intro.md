Course Syllabus for "HIST211: Introduction to United States History - Colonial Period to Reconstruction"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to United States history from the
colonial period to the Civil War and Reconstruction. You will learn
about the major political, economic, and social changes that took place
in America during this 250-year period. The course will be structured
chronologically, with each unit focusing on a significant historical
subject in early American history. The units will include representative
primary-source documents that illustrate important overarching
political, economic, and social themes, such as the development of
British America, the founding of the American republic, and the crisis
of the federal union that led to the Civil War. By the end of the
course, you will understand how the American federal union was founded,
expanded, and tested from 1776 to its collapse in 1861.
