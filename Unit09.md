**Unit 9: Secession** <span id="9"></span> 
*In 1860, it was by no means clear that the South would secede or that
civil war would be unleashed between two rival sections of the same
nation. Instead, most Americans, though wearied by a decade of sectional
disputes, were still in favor of preserving the federal union. But
following Abraham Lincoln’s election to the presidency, the skirmish at
Fort Sumter, and Lincoln’s order of federal troops into the Southern
states, Southern states began to secede from the union.  
  
 In this unit, you will study the four-way political contest of the
presidential election of 1860 between Northern Democrats, Southern
Democrats, the Republicans, and the Constitutional Unionists. Because
Abraham Lincoln, the winner of that contest, was elected without the
support of a single Southern state, some Southerners felt alienated from
their own country, which led to the establishment of the Confederate
States of America.*

     Instructions: Read these articles, which discuss the causes of
    secession and the establishment of the Confederate government in
    Richmond, Virginia, in 1861. While South Carolina was the first
    Southern state to secede from the Union, 10 additional states soon
    followed. Secessionists argued that the U.S. Constitution was a
    contract among states that could be abandoned at any time without
    consultation and that each state had a right to secede. On the other
    hand, the Union rejected secession as illegal.  In your opinion,
    which position had more merit? Why?  
      
     Reading these articles and answering the questions above should
    take approximately 30 minutes.

     Instructions: Read this webpage.  In this Declaration, the people
    of South Carolina assert their legitimate claim to independence from
    the federal union.  Just as the colonies seceded from Britain
    because of relentless oppression and tyranny in 1776, so too does
    South Carolina secede from an oppressive and tyrannical federal
    government in 1860.
