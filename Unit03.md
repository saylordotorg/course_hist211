**Unit 3: The Early Republic** <span id="3"></span> 
*The Early American Republic emerged amidst a period of modernization,
expansion, and international conflict. The fragile new nation faced a
number of threats that challenged its strength and stability, including
the emergence of factionalism, divisive political parties, international
crises, and the new pressures brought about by westward expansion. The
Louisiana Purchase, the War of 1812, slavery, and new agricultural and
commercial developments forced Americans to rethink the nature of their
union.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will begin by examining Jefferson’s ascendancy to
the presidency – what he termed the “revolution of 1800” – as well as
the successes and pitfalls of his tenure in office. You will then
examine the tremendous innovation and expansion characteristic of the
growing nation, including the development of Eli Whitney’s cotton gin
and new settlements in the Louisiana territory. Finally, you will define
the period known as the Era of Good Feelings, characterized by a wave of
nationalism and new foreign policy.*
