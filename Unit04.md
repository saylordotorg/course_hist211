**Unit 4: Democracy in America** <span id="4"></span> 
*In the 1820s and 1830s, all signs seemed to point toward the rise of a
mature democratic nation*: *the period saw record-high voter turnouts at
elections, a number of new reform agendas, and unprecedented economic
growth, which fostered optimism about the future of the new nation.
Still, the emergence of* *Jacksonian Democracy* *did not obscure growing
rifts in the American people, as Northerners and Southerners perceived
equality differently, and slavery and federal Indian removal policies
threatened to undermine what appeared to be a more democratic
America.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will begin with an examination of the impact that
Andrew Jackson had on American politics and interrogate the term*
Jacksonian Democracy *by asking what democracy truly meant in America in
the 1830s. Next, you will consider the problems facing the nation during
Jackson’s presidency, including the Nullification Crisis and the Bank
War.*

     Instructions: Read this article about the presidency of Andrew
    Jackson. President Jackson’s tenure in office helped usher in a
    newly democratic age marked by increased voter turnout. Jackson, for
    better or worse, turned the presidency into a vastly more powerful
    office than previous administrations. However, these years would
    also be marked by significant sectional differences and an
    increasingly hostile debate over federal versus state power. This
    reading also examines the presidency of Martin Van Buren (1837–1841)
    and the Panic of 1837. Please note that this material also covers
    the topics outlined in subunits 4.1.1 through 4.2.3.
