**Unit 5: North and South** <span id="5"></span> 
*The new democratic spirit of the early 19<sup>th</sup> century was also
threatened by growing sectional differences and ideologies*:
*Northerners believed that their society was characterized by
antislavery beliefs, a system of wage labor, and efficient urban
factories, while Southerners, by contrast, thought that their society
was premised on the “positive good” of slavery, a system of enslaved
labor, and a profitable plantation network.  
  
 In this unit, you will explore how the North and the South came to view
their societies during the antebellum years. You will examine the social
conditions, economic policies, and racial attitudes of each region in
order to understand how and why these two sections of the United States
could coexist within the same federal union despite such seemingly
drastic differences.*

     This resource gives a good overview of Northern anti-slavery
    thought and abolitionism. It is important to note, however, that
    abolitionists – those who called for immediate emancipation –
    comprised a tiny minority in the Northern states. Instead, most
    Northerners were anti-black, anti-slavery, and pro-colonization.

    which involved the settlement of freed slaves from the United States
    in the new nation of Liberia in West Africa. Prior to the emergence
    of the abolitionist movement in the 1830s, colonization was the
    focus of anti-slavery reformers, including some prominent slave
    owners, such as President James Monroe.

    by David Walker, a free black living in Boston, rejected the moral
    suasion and gradualism of the anti-slavery movement of the time in
    favor of more radical action on the part of slaves. As you read,
    note Walker’s approach to the issue of slavery and how to abolish
    it. Why might Walker have been considered a radical at the time?

     Instructions: Read this webpage. The city of Lowell, Massachusetts,
    was the birthplace of a new kind of industrial factory system, in
    which the spinning and weaving of cloth were completed under the
    same roof. The Lowell System, as this innovation was called,
    attracted thousands of young women from poor farming families to
    work in factories. Workers soon discovered, however, the dangerous,
    oppressive, and exploitative nature of the system and a rebellion
    occurred in 1834, as the Lowell Mill Girls agitated for better
    treatment. The strike was unsuccessful. Inthis eyewitness report
    from 1846, note the possible reasons why the mill workers were
    dissatisfied.
