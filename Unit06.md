**Unit 6: An Age of Reform and Resistance** <span id="6"></span> 
*The antebellum years were a period of rapid social change in America.
Many distinct groups – including religious sects, slaves, free blacks,
and women – asserted their claim to equal rights in a democratic nation.
Perceiving that American society was in need of reform, these groups
either sought to change existing institutions or to forge new ones.
Evangelicals (particularly in the South) as well as Shakers and Mormons
sought to restore an earlier, more primitive form of Christianity to
America. And in order to solve the problem of Southern slavery and
Northern free blacks, many anti-slavery reformers devised plans to
colonize blacks in Africa. Other bleak aspects of American society,
including the prison system and the prevalence of alcoholic beverages,
spurred the formation of the Temperance Movement and prison reform
movement. Meanwhile, Southern slaves planned or carried out revolts in
Virginia and South Carolina in an attempt to resist enslavement and gain
their freedom.  
  
 In this unit, you will examine how the antebellum era was an era of
reform. Some Americans, such as anti-slavery proponents and members of
new religious groups attempted moral reform, while others (prison
reformers, Temperance Movement supporters, Utopians and
transcendentalists, public educators, women’s rights activists, and
rebellious slaves) focused on social reform. By studying all of these
groups and their reform objectives, you will understand that reform cut
both ways in antebellum America: While many groups had seemingly
progressive and democratizing goals, they were also often racist and
socially conservative.*
